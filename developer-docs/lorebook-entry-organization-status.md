# Lorebook entry organization: backend implementation and verification

## Final PR handoff — October 4, 2026

### SillyTavern compatibility follow-up

The user subsequently tested the 44-entry export in SillyTavern: upload succeeded and the count showed 44, but no rows appeared. PR #421 was immediately converted to draft. Comparison with the user's ST-native export and [ST's release source](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/public/scripts/world-info.js) identified mismatched entry-map keys (`0`, `1`, ...) and UUID `uid` values, plus character-book field names in a native ST payload. ST's editor locates a row through `data.entries[entry.uid]`; a successful upload/count did not prove rendering.

The ST exporter now emits numeric UIDs matching each map key and uses native `key`, `keysecondary`, `order`, `disable`, numeric roles and camel-case setting names. Canonical saved settings override imported extension aliases; stale aliases and local organization/revision metadata are omitted. Unknown ST extension fields such as `characterFilter` remain. Native Lumiverse and character-book exports keep their existing identity/field contracts. ST `displayIndex` is the exported row index; Lumiverse's existing import precedence uses that visual index rather than insertion order on ST reimport.

A controlled 44-entry regression exercises ST's UID-based row lookup, array keys, setting mapping, stale extension collisions, organization omission and unchanged native UIDs. Final focused backend/runtime checks: **464 pass, 0 fail; 2,953 assertions across 46 files**. Backend TypeScript passes. A repaired copy of the user's export is outside the repository for live validation; personal entries and content are not committed. The user imported the repaired 44-entry export into SillyTavern and confirmed it worked; the screenshot shows the successful import and rendered rows, and the user confirmed keys/content acceptance in the follow-up reply. Live ST rendering acceptance is complete. The running backend must reload this source before newly generated exports use the fix. PR returns to ready for review after the fix is pushed.


The user completed desktop/mobile visual review and live export/reimport checks, then authorized commit, push and PR creation. Native Lumiverse export retained Beta in folder `a` and Alpha in folder `b`, with exact tags including the single comma-containing `a,b` tag; Reimporting the SillyTavern-shaped file into Lumiverse omitted organization, but this did not establish compatibility with SillyTavern itself; the follow-up below corrects that acceptance claim. The two exported files were parsed and matching UIDs, content and activation values compared. Export files and personal data are not included in the repository.

Freshly fetched canonical `upstream/staging` is still `27a9660bc264ea4b440909d8b5d00b4502f414ce`, already an ancestor of this branch; no further rebase was necessary. Final focused backend/runtime checks: **463 pass, 0 fail**, 2,335 assertions across 46 files. Final frontend checks including the existing workspace bulk suite: **72 pass, 0 fail**, 364 assertions across ten files. Backend TypeScript and final frontend TypeScript/checked production build and lint pass. Final workspace diagnostics pass 30 Chromium/Firefox/WebKit viewport/scale cases. Organization diagnostics pass 18 Chromium/Firefox cases plus nine isolated WebKit cases. Two WebKit Enter-submit close waits timed out on prior attempts; an isolated rerun passed all nine without a product change, and failure-context logging now records engine/viewport/scale, dialog state and focus for diagnosis. This intermittent timing issue remains disclosed. The full-suite results below remain historical and are not claimed as green.

The final UI includes independent Books and contextual Folder/Entry navigation, retained workspace tabs, optional desktop split, native maximize/restore, scaled draggable column edges and a mobile editing header. Sidebar entries retain inline compact forms and their outer panel scroll owner. Activation choices, compact rows, theme-aware section surfaces and organization controls were reviewed live. The form/workspace follow-up documents describe the final behavior and regression fixes; earlier implementation notes below are historical snapshots.

Only intentional source, tests and developer documentation are committed. The generated `frontend/dist` stays uncommitted while serving the user's live review instance and is excluded from the PR. Dependencies, lockfiles and local configuration are unchanged. Prolix's maintainer review remains outstanding.


Branch: `codex/lorebook-entry-organization`. Isolated worktree: `.worktrees/lorebook-entry-organization`.

Started from freshly fetched, pristine `upstream/staging` at `eaab8aa70deb7c509aed141c04c5a73a0901d979`. Rebased at the user's request onto current `upstream/staging`, `0284320f82c1c16287f7c0c632c6db399ce95b83`, on October 4, 2026. The temporary autostash was restored successfully; SHA-256 checks confirmed all 30 implementation files were preserved byte-for-byte. The user authorized a local feature commit and a further rebase on October 4, 2026. No push or PR is authorized; the aesthetics pass is pending. The existing desktop-update checkout was preserved.

The backend/API and native folder/tag UI are implemented. Controlled tests and the live test-instance audit are complete; human device acceptance and Prolix review remain outstanding.

## Implemented behavior

- Migration 122 adds dedicated folder/tags columns. Baseline schema and migration bookkeeping match upgrades; existing rows default to Unfiled with no tags.
- Entry CRUD, duplication, bulk copying and imports preserve normalized, case-sensitive organization. Folder names and tags are trimmed; tags are deduplicated. Malformed stored JSON is read defensively; malformed mutation inputs fail before writes.
- Folder, all-of tag, activation-type and text filters compose before server pagination. Organization summaries contain book-wide folder/tag counts and enforce ownership.
- Atomic folder rename/merge, remove/unfile and move operate without requiring the client to download every matching entry. Bulk moves accept a destination folder; bulk tag actions add/remove instead of replacing unrelated tags.
- Same-book moves preserve lore order and vector state. Organization-only single/bulk edits neither enqueue nor delete vectors, including pending/error states. Cross-book moves retain the existing absolute order and reset/queue eligible vector indexes.
- Mutations enforce book ownership and existing entry revision checks; transactional failures roll back selection updates. Entry URLs reject entries from a different book, including another owned book.
- Tagged native exports and native CharX modules round-trip organization. Standard imports preserve foreign folder/tags in extensions without claiming their meaning. Standard exports omit dedicated native organization. Native imports narrowly recover older native fields from extensions.
- Runtime activation, budget/order/cache output and embedding search text remain independent of organization. Native runtime defaults work without Suite.
- Entry ETags incorporate revisions, preventing stale 304 responses after organization edits within one timestamp second.
- Frontend types and API support filtered reads, summaries, folder actions and additive bulk tags. Repeated tag query parameters safely preserve commas, Unicode and query delimiters.

## Verification

Automated tests used controlled in-memory databases and temporary CharX fixtures. The live audit created two controlled test books; existing personal lorebooks, settings and credentials were not changed.

- Focused backend/runtime suite: **461 pass, 0 fail; 2,333 assertions across 46 files** after rebasing.
- Frontend API and relevant editor regression suites: **28 pass, 0 fail; 190 assertions across four files**.
- Backend typecheck: pass. Frontend typecheck followed by lint: pass.
- Broad isolated test sweep: **5,233 pass, 70 fail, 2 module-loading errors**. All 68 named failures and both erroring test cases reproduce in a clean snapshot of the same base commit with matching checkout line endings. These include Windows/path/source-string assumptions, sandbox subprocess restrictions, media codecs, registry drift, existing editor behavior, and Vite/DnD module loading. They were not modified as part of this feature. Both runs used the execution sandbox: baseline reproduction establishes independence from the feature, not failure outside the sandbox. Subprocess EPERM and codec failures need an ordinary-terminal rerun. Current staging also contains fixes for earlier failures. The broad sweep preceded the final ETag fix and rebase; focused suites and typechecks were rerun afterward.
- Source whitespace/diff review: pass; index empty. No dependency, lockfile or personal configuration changes. Generated frontend/dist currently contains the running live build; cleanup before staging remains outstanding.

Focused backend reproduction from the repository root (PowerShell):

```powershell
$tests = @(rg --files src | rg '(world-books|world-info|world-book-vector|prompt-assembly|embeddings-world-book|migrate-122|migrate\.baseline-sync).*\.test\.ts$')
bun test --isolate @tests
```

Regression coverage includes populated upgrade/fresh schema parity, migration failure rollback, invalid JSON/body types, malformed/scalar/object tag storage, owner/missing/wrong-book selections, stale revisions, SQL-trigger rollback, all vector states, literal SQL metacharacters, 160 filter combinations over 2,107 entries, chunked import cancellation, real CharX export/extract/import, foreign/native field isolation, and same-second cache invalidation.

## Native UI implementation and verification

- The existing core modal and sidebar share folder navigation in the entry-list content region. All entries, Unfiled, and named folders use book-wide counts; the list retains its existing scroll owner.
- Folder, all-of tag, text and activation filters now use server pagination. Large-book regression fixtures cover 2,107 entries, later-page navigation and tag/folder composition. Older stored All-page preferences are bounded to the normal page size; drag reorder is enabled only for a complete, unfiltered book view.
- Entry editing exposes folder suggestions/create and tag chips/suggestions. New entries inherit the current folder and tag scope. Organization-only changes remain runtime/vector inert.
- Selected-entry and row-context moves share one destination-book/folder dialog, including same-book, existing/new folder and Unfiled destinations. Folder rename/merge, remove/unfile and whole-folder move use atomic server actions. Add/remove tags are additive.
- Dialogs retain forms on failures, snapshot selected IDs and revisions, reject silent selection drift, and require reconciliation after stale revisions, uncertain responses or successful writes followed by failed reloads. Book/query changes cannot apply superseded list responses. Folder actions update navigation after confirmed reloads.
- Suite-gated full/half editor paths were traced and left outside the feature. No new Suite imports, gates, attributes or dependency paths were added. The one-line Workspace test-fixture change supplies required entry metadata fields.

Focused frontend verification: **53 pass, 0 fail; 267 assertions across seven files**. Backend/runtime coverage remains **461 pass, 0 fail**. Backend typecheck and frontend `bun run typecheck` followed by lint passed. The final source also passed the local TypeScript compiler and lint with no errors or warnings after the last navigation/request-guard changes. The sandboxed follow-up compiler did not finish; it was stopped and rerun with Node outside the sandbox.

Browser diagnostics use `scripts/e2e-diagnostics/check-entry-organization.mjs` and controlled memory fixtures, with actual core folder/tag components inside the existing ModalShell. Chromium, Firefox and WebKit passed **27 viewport/scale cases**: widths 1,200/390/320 at scales 0.8/1/1.5. Checks exercise mouse/keyboard, native-dialog focus trapping/restoration, Escape without closing the parent modal, Enter submission, all-of tags including commas, close/reopen persistence, tag add/remove and remove-folder preservation. This does not establish full deployed-application persistence or real mobile PWA behavior.

Live audit completed against the feature worktree's production build at `http://kl:7860/` on October 4, 2026. Only two newly created controlled books were mutated: `Codex organization live-check 2026-10-04` and `Codex organization destination 2026-10-04`. Both remain for reviewer inspection; the source is empty and the destination has Alpha/Beta in Unfiled. Existing personal books were not changed. No credentials were saved in tests, reports or screenshots.

Live checks exercised sidebar and native modal folder navigation/counts, trimmed rename, rename into an existing folder (merge), selected same-book moves including blank Unfiled, whole-folder cross-book move, folder removal preserving entries, additive tag add/remove, exact comma-containing tags, and all-of filtering excluding the one-tag entry. Entry content, tags and lore order survived the moves and a full browser reload. Vector activation was disabled on live fixtures; vector-state preservation is covered by backend tests, not claimed as a live enabled-vector check.

Desktop (1,200 x 900) and narrow viewport (390 x 844) interactions were exercised, including entry fields, scrolling, nested move dialog focus, Escape closing only the nested dialog, and parent-modal retention. The narrow viewport exposed a CSS-reset defect: native dialog default centering had been removed. Added `margin: auto` and horizontal/vertical centering assertions to the diagnostics harness; all 27 Chromium/Firefox/WebKit viewport/scale cases passed again. The rebuilt live page was reloaded and the move dialog measured x=19.5, y=250.71875, width=351, height=342.5625 in the 390 x 844 viewport, with focus inside it. Temporary viewport overrides were reset. This is browser responsive testing, not physical-phone/PWA acceptance.

Live screenshots are outside the repository in the task visualization directory: `lorebook-live-desktop.png`, `lorebook-live-mobile.png`, and `lorebook-live-mobile-dialog.png`. The final production build passed and is preserved at `%TEMP%\lumiverse-lorebook-organization-live-preview-01a10465`. Generated frontend/dist remains in the worktree while the user's live instance serves it; do not stage it. Before preparing the PR, launch the feature backend with `FRONTEND_DIR` pointing to the preserved build (keeping the user's test database), then restore/remove only generated dist differences. No server was stopped or restarted by this audit. The user reports reviewing during the live audit and finishing mobile/desktop visual checks. Prolix review and a planned aesthetics pass remain pending. A local feature commit is authorized; no push or PR will be performed.

Browser reproduction from repository root, after installing the existing diagnostics package's dependencies/browser binaries:

```powershell
node scripts/e2e-diagnostics/check-entry-organization.mjs
```

An existing Playwright installation can be supplied with `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE`. The fixture never logs in or reads user data. Credentials must stay out of fixture source, test reports and commits.

## Ordinary-terminal broad rerun

Use a normal, unelevated PowerShell window, outside Codex's execution sandbox:

```powershell
Set-Location 'C:\Users\eisen\Documents\Ai Tools\LumiTest\Lumiverse\.worktrees\lorebook-entry-organization'
bun test --isolate src 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath "$env:TEMP\lorebook-organization-unsandboxed.log"
```

This reproduces the original broad command, including matching frontend suites. Keep isolation enabled. The user completed the ordinary-terminal rerun: **5,296 pass, 20 fail, 1 error; 62,167 assertions across 707 files, 304.68 seconds**. No lorebook organization suite failed. No claim is made that all earlier failures were sandbox-caused; the base also changed. The earlier log specifically reports EPERM launching Bun/Git in Spindle worker/Git-probe tests, subprocess wrappers, frontend isolated child-process tests, and LanceDB integration tests; image/video codecs also require verification outside the sandbox.

Remaining ordinary-terminal failures include seven Termux path assertions on Windows, two desktop source-string/newline assertions, two AVIF metadata assertions (`heif` received vs `avif` expected), registry ordering drift, outbox/edit-and-send/history fixture failures, a long-message hook timeout, a controlled Loom child-test failure, and a DnD `getClientRect` import failure. The outbox failure, two Edit-and-Send route failures, and generation-history failure were reproduced independently on a clean temporary snapshot updated to current staging. This comparison still used the sandbox, so it does not replace the user's ordinary-terminal run; it establishes that these four failures occur without the feature changes. The remaining failures have not all been individually rerun on current clean staging outside the sandbox.

Full ordinary-terminal output: `%TEMP%\lorebook-organization-unsandboxed.log`. Clean current-staging four-failure reproduction: `%TEMP%\lorebook-current-baseline-remaining.log`. Unrelated failures were not fixed within the lorebook feature branch.

Detailed failure-by-failure handoff: [lorebook-entry-organization-test-failures.md](lorebook-entry-organization-test-failures.md). It separates observed failures from hypotheses and records the mismatch between the aggregate failure count and named log markers.

## Commit and staging refresh

The feature was committed locally at the user's request as `1b8ef479` after rebasing onto freshly fetched `upstream/staging` at `27a9660b` without conflicts. Upstream changes do not overlap this feature's modified files or generated dist. Generated live build bytes are checked before and after rebase; they are excluded from the commit and retained for the ongoing visual review. The ordinary-terminal failure report remains a historical report of the earlier base; newer staging includes fixes for several recorded failures. No new full-suite result is inferred from those fixes.

Post-rebase focused checks: **463 backend/runtime tests pass, 0 fail; 2,335 assertions across 46 files**; **53 frontend tests pass, 0 fail; 267 assertions across seven files**. Backend and frontend TypeScript checks and frontend lint passed with no errors or warnings. Git converted one generated Workbox asset to CRLF when restoring the temporary autostash; its original bytes were restored from the saved build after proving that only newline representation differed. All 29 served build files match the preserved production build byte-for-byte. Source diff whitespace checks pass, and only generated dist remains dirty. The live build is the previously verified build; it was deliberately retained during the user's ongoing aesthetics review rather than rebuilding or restarting their running server.

## Native workspace structural pass

The subsequent, uncommitted layout pass is documented in [lorebook-workspace-first-pass.md](lorebook-workspace-first-pass.md). Its new verification results do not replace the historical full-suite failure report above.
